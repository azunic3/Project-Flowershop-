## System Purpose
Ayana Florist offers services for purchasing bouquets for various occasions, gift packages, as well as the option to create personal rose boxes and messages. It also provides a subscription feature where users can select dates or occasions for annual bouquets, along with a surprise box as a gift. Bouquets can be searched by occasions (March 8th, birthdays, weddings, thank you bouquets, Valentine's Day, etc.) as well as by the type of flowers you want your bouquet to contain and the price range. Users can add bouquets to their favorites or remove them. If the user doesn't like the color of a flower, they can leave a note about their preferred color, and if the florist has flowers of that color available, the bouquet will be made accordingly. Personal rose boxes consist of customized sweets and a rose in the desired color, and customers can choose the color of the box. Payment can be made by credit card or upon pickup. Pickup options include home delivery (free shipping) or collection from nearby locations. Customers can rate their orders on a scale of 1 to 5 stars.
